# PokeAPI in React

This little application is for me to practice some parts of React that I hadn't used before. 

This is using the [https://pokeapi.co](PokeAPI), which is an open API for fetching details about Pokemon characters.

I have used this, not becuase of an overwhelming interest in pokemon but because it has a large amount of data that I can access to pracice fetching from APIs using React and the fetch API.
